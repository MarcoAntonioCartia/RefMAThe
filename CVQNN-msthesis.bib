	abstract = {Time series prediction is essential for human activities in diverse areas. A common approach to this task is to harness recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, while their predictions are quite accurate, their learning process is complex and, thus, time and energy consuming. Here, we propose to extend the concept of RRNs by including continuous-variable quantum resources in it and to use a quantum-enhanced RNN to overcome these obstacles. The design of the continuous-variable quantum RNN (CV-QRNN) is rooted in the continuous-variable quantum computing paradigm. By performing extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the quantum network is capable of learning-time dependence of several types of temporal data and that it converges to the optimal weights in fewer epochs than a classical network. Furthermore, for a small number of trainable parameters, it can achieve lower losses than its classical counterpart. CV-QRNN can be implemented using commercially available quantum-photonic hardware.},

Neural networks can be used against cryptosystems; they can play roles in cryptanalysis and attacks against encryption algorithms and encrypted data. This side of the dichotomy can be interpreted as a war declared by neural networks. On the other hand, neural networks and cryptographic algorithms can mutually support each other. Neural networks can help improve the performance and the security of cryptosystems, and encryption techniques can support the conﬁdentiality of neural networks. The latter side of the dichotomy can be referred to as the peace. There are, to the best of our knowledge, no current surveys that take a comprehensive look at the many ways neural networks are currently interacting with cryptography. This survey aims to ﬁll that niche by providing an overview on the state of the cross-impact between neural networks and cryptography systems. To this end, this paper will highlight the current areas where progress is being made as well as the aspects where there is room for future research to be conducted.},

Quantum computers, quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments.},

We implemented 2 specific methods: natural evolutionary strategy stochastic gradient descent (NESSGD) and natural evolutionary strategy adapting the step size according to belief in observed gradients (NESAdaBelief) to optimize PQC parameter values. They were compared with standard stochastic gradient descent, adaptive moment estimation, and a version of adaptive moment estimation adapting the step size according to belief in observed gradients in 5 classification tasks. NESSGD and NESAdaBelief demonstrated some superiority in 4 of the tasks. NESAdaBelief showed higher accuracy than AdaBelief in all 5 tasks. In addition, we investigated the applicability of NESSGD under the parameter shift rule and demonstrated that NESSGD can adapt to this rule, which means that our proposed method could also optimize the parameters of PQCs on quantum computers.},

The QCNN architecture combines the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz and quantum error correction. We explicitly illustrate its potential with two examples. First, QCNN is used to accurately recognize quantum states associated with 1D symmetry-protected topological phases. We numerically demonstrate that a QCNN trained on a small set of exactly solvable points can reproduce the phase diagram over the entire parameter regime and also provide an exact, analytical QCNN solution. As a second application, we utilize QCNNs to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given error model. We provide a generic framework to simultaneously optimize both encoding and decoding procedures and find that the resultant scheme significantly outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity. Finally, potential experimental realization and generalizations of QCNNs are discussed.},

In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number \$N\$ of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with \$T\$ trainable gates scales at worst as \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{T/N\}\$. When only \$K {\textbackslash}ll T\$ gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{K / N\}\$. Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.},

This fact may be surprising since a single qubit only offers a simple superposition of two states and single-qubit gates only make a rotation in the Bloch sphere. The key ingredient to circumvent these limitations is to allow for multiple data re-uploading. A quantum circuit can then be organized as a series of data re-uploading and single-qubit processing units. Furthermore, both data re-uploading and measurements can accommodate multiple dimensions in the input and several categories in the output, to conform to a universal quantum classifier. The extension of this idea to several qubits enhances the efficiency of the strategy as entanglement expands the superpositions carried along with the classification. Extensive benchmarking on different examples of the single- and multi-qubit quantum classifier validates its ability to describe and classify complex data.},

	abstract = {As IoT technology develops, many sensor devices are being used in our life. To protect such sensor data, lightweight block cipher techniques such as SPECK-32 are applied. However, attack techniques for these lightweight ciphers are also being studied. Block ciphers have differential characteristics, which are probabilistically predictable, so deep learning has been utilized to solve this problem. Since Gohr’s work at Crypto2019, many studies on deep-learning-based distinguishers have been conducted. Currently, as quantum computers are developed, quantum neural network technology is developing. Quantum neural networks can also learn and make predictions on data, just like classical neural networks. However, current quantum computers are constrained by many factors (e.g., the scale and execution time of available quantum computers), making it difﬁcult for quantum neural networks to outperform classical neural networks. Quantum computers have higher performance and computational speed than classical computers, but this cannot be achieved in the current quantum computing environment. Nevertheless, it is very important to ﬁnd areas where quantum neural networks work for technology development in the future. In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst quantum neural network based distinguisher for the block cipher SPECK-32 in an NISQ. Our quantum neural distinguisher successfully operated for up to 5 rounds even under constrained conditions. As a result of our experiment, the classical neural distinguisher achieved an accuracy of 0.93, but our quantum neural distinguisher achieved an accuracy of 0.53 due to limitations in data, time, and parameters. Due to the constrained environment, it cannot exceed the performance of classical neural networks, but it can operate as a distinguisher because it has obtained an accuracy of 0.51 or higher. In addition, we performed an in-depth analysis of the quantum neural network’s various factors that affect the performance of the quantum neural distinguisher. As a result, it was conﬁrmed that the embedding method, the number of the qubit, and quantum layers, etc., have an effect. It turns out that if a high-capacity network is needed, we have to properly tune properly to take into account the connectivity and complexity of the circuit, not just by adding quantum resources. In the future, if more quantum resources, data, and time become available, it is expected that an approach to achieve better performance can be designed by considering the various factors presented in this paper.},

              An efficient cryptography scheme is proposed based on continuous-variable quantum neural network (CV-QNN), in which a specified CV-QNN model is introduced for designing the quantum cryptography algorithm. It indicates an approach to design a quantum neural cryptosystem which contains the processes of key generation, encryption and decryption. Security analysis demonstrates that our scheme is security. Several simulation experiments are performed on the Strawberry Fields platform for processing the classical data “Quantum Cryptography” with CV-QNN to describe the feasibility of our method. Three sets of representative experiments are presented and the second experimental results confirm that our scheme can correctly and effectively encrypt and decrypt data with the optimal learning rate 8

	abstract = {A frequent starting point of quantum computation platforms are two-state quantum systems, i.e., qubits. However, in the context of integer optimization problems, relevant to scheduling optimization and operations research, it is often more resource-efficient to employ quantum systems with more than two basis states, so-called qudits. Here, we discuss the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) for qudit systems. We illustrate how the QAOA can be used to formulate a variety of integer optimization problems such as graph coloring problems or electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization. In addition, we comment on the implementation of constraints and describe three methods to include these into a quantum circuit of a QAOA by penalty contributions to the cost Hamiltonian, conditional gates using ancilla qubits, and a dynamical decoupling strategy. Finally, as a showcase of qudit-based QAOA, we present numerical results for a charging optimization problem mapped onto a max-\$k\$-graph coloring problem. Our work illustrates the flexibility of qudit systems to solve integer optimization problems.},

	abstract = {We introduce a general method for building neural networks on quantum computers. The quantum neural network is a variational quantum circuit built in the continuous-variable (CV) architecture, which encodes quantum information in continuous degrees of freedom such as the amplitudes of the electromagnetic field. This circuit contains a layered structure of continuously parameterized gates which is universal for CV quantum computation. Affine transformations and nonlinear activation functions, two key elements in neural networks, are enacted in the quantum network using Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates, respectively. The non-Gaussian gates provide both the nonlinearity and the universality of the model. Due to the structure of the CV model, the CV quantum neural network can encode highly nonlinear transformations while remaining completely unitary. We show how a classical network can be embedded into the quantum formalism and propose quantum versions of various specialized model such as convolutional, recurrent, and residual networks. Finally, we present numerous modeling experiments built with the Strawberry Fields software library. These experiments, including a classifier for fraud detection, a network which generates Tetris images, and a hybrid classical-quantum autoencoder, demonstrate the capability and adaptability of CV quantum neural networks.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have demonstrated theoretical and experimental performance superior to their classical counterparts in a wide range of applications. However, existing centralized QNNs cannot solve many real-world problems because collecting large amounts of training data to a common public site is time-consuming and, more importantly, violates data privacy. Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning framework that allows collaborative model training on decentralized data residing on multiple devices without breaching data privacy. Some initial attempts at Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) either only focus on improving the QFL performance or rely on a trusted quantum server that fails to preserve data privacy. In this work, we propose CryptoQFL, a QFL framework that allows distributed QNN training on encrypted data. CryptoQFL is (1) secure, because it allows each edge to train a QNN with local private data, and encrypt its updates using quantum {\textbackslash}homo{\textasciitilde}encryption before sending them to the central quantum server; (2) communication-efficient, as CryptoQFL quantize local gradient updates to ternary values, and only communicate non-zero values to the server for aggregation; and (3) computation-efficient, as CryptoQFL presents an efficient quantum aggregation circuit with significantly reduced latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Generative Modelling has become a promising use case for near term quantum computers. In particular, due to the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, quantum computers naturally model and learn probability distributions, perhaps more efficiently than can be achieved classically. The Born machine is an example of such a model, easily implemented on near term quantum computers. However, in its original form, the Born machine only naturally represents discrete distributions. Since probability distributions of a continuous nature are commonplace in the world, it is essential to have a model which can efficiently represent them. Some proposals have been made in the literature to supplement the discrete Born machine with extra features to more easily learn continuous distributions, however, all invariably increase the resources required to some extent. In this work, we present the continuous variable Born machine, built on the alternative architecture of continuous variable quantum computing, which is much more suitable for modelling such distributions in a resource-minimal way. We provide numerical results indicating the models ability to learn both quantum and classical continuous distributions, including in the presence of noise.},

	abstract = {Bosonic continuous-variable Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are crucial for information processing in cavity quantum electrodynamics and optical systems, widely applicable in quantum communication, sensing and error correction. The trainability of such VQCs is less understood, hindered by the lack of theoretical tools such as \$t\$-design due to the infinite dimension of the physical systems involved. We overcome this difficulty to reveal an energy-dependent barren plateau in such VQCs. The variance of the gradient decays as \$1/E{\textasciicircum}\{M{\textbackslash}nu\}\$, exponential in the number of modes \$M\$ but polynomial in the (per-mode) circuit energy \$E\$. The exponent \${\textbackslash}nu=1\$ for shallow circuits and \${\textbackslash}nu=2\$ for deep circuits. We prove these results for state preparation of general Gaussian states and number states. We also provide numerical evidence that the results extend to general state preparation tasks. As circuit energy is a controllable parameter, we provide a strategy to mitigate the barren plateau in continuous-variable VQCs.},
